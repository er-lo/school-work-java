<!-- ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY -->
## About This Repository

I wanted to create a few repositories to showcase the assignments I worked on throughout my education. This repository will host my Java assignments. I will admit I am uploading these projects way after I have already finished the courses, so I will do my best to explain what the purpose of each assignment was. Please do not use or copy my code if you are taking either the Java or Advanced Java class at OCCC.
